# My Personal Project

## Grocerlytics 

*What will the application do?*

* My application will allow users to quickly search for their desired
groceries, and it will list all the available stores that have that type
of groceries, which has their prices, reviews (if available), location (from 
nearest to furthest), etc. 
* Users can compare their selected grocery between 2 stores in the list;
compare their prices, reviews, etc.

*Who will use it?*

* Family members
* Chefs 
* Restaurant Managers/Owners
* Students
* People in general

*Why is this project of interest to you?*
* As the prices for groceries are still rising at a very high annual pace. 
So it is even more crucial to save money and be smart on how we organize 
our spendings. Furthermore, food is something that is essential in our everyday 
living and finding affordable prices on food is very important. Especially for 
students who are on a tight budget but still need to provide for their food needs. 
However, this is not just for students, but for everybody.
